In the three example cpp files, the function std::to_string() is used. Because this function is
available since c++0x, please turn on '-std=gnu++0x' or '-std=c++0x' to compile. A recommended way 
is to add the following codes into your 'CMakeLists.txt' file.

if(UNIX)
	    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=gnu++0x")
endif()
