[Examples description]
compute_cones.cpp: this example computes the cone boundaries given the number of cones
   and the initial direction. 

theta_io.cpp: this example constructs a Theta graph exactly with an input file containing a vertex list,
   and then generates the Gnuplot files for plotting the constructed Theta graph.

dijkstra_theta.cpp: this example constructs Theta graph first and then calculates 
   the shortest paths on this graph by calling the Dijkstra's algorithm from BGL.

[Compilation]
In the examples, the function std::to_string() is used. Because this function is
available since c++0x, please turn on '-std=gnu++0x' or '-std=c++0x' to compile. A recommended way 
is to add the following codes into your 'CMakeLists.txt' file.

if(UNIX)
	    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=gnu++0x")
endif()
