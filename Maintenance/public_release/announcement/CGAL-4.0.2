Subject: CGAL 4.0.2 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body:

Dear CGAL users,

Yesterday, I have published a buggy release 4.0.1, where a bug in the
CMakeLists.txt for CGAL prevented even to build the CGAL libraries. That
bug slipped through our automatic tests.

I have just published a new release 4.0.2 which fixes this problem.
